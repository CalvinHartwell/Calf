Calf - Calvin's lite Multiplatform MVC Framework. 
====================================================================

Project Description: 

After having built multiple applications in PHP I started this project to provide a very 
light-weight and reusable PHP framework which could be used to easily deploy websites. 

The framework is derived from an MVC design pattern which has been around for many years, it is very easy
to understand and modify. 

Since the initial project creation, I've also added multiple other MVC frameworks for other languages and platforms, 
including Google's Android and many others.
